### Supabase Authentication Debugging (2024-12-20)
- Issue: Supabase client initialization not completing in Next.js app
- Symptoms:
  - Sign-in button remains in "initializing" state
  - No error messages in console
  - Client initialization appears to hang
- Attempted Solutions:
  1. Direct Supabase client creation:
     - Switched from `createClientComponentClient` to `createClient`
     - Added explicit auth configuration
     - Result: No improvement
  2. Enhanced logging:
     - Added detailed client initialization logs
     - Added environment variable checks
     - Added state tracking
     - Result: Logs not appearing, suggesting possible earlier initialization issue
  3. Client Configuration Changes:
     - Added explicit storage configuration
     - Added debug mode
     - Added session persistence settings
     - Result: No change in behavior

## Patterns
### Authentication Best Practices
- Initialize Supabase client with explicit configuration
- Include error boundaries for initialization
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Verify environment variables before client creation

## Performance Insights
- Client initialization should be immediate
- Hanging initialization suggests possible environment or configuration issues

## Tools and Libraries
### Supabase
- @supabase/supabase-js
- @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs
- Configuration requires:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
